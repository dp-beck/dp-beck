# 👋 Hi, I’m Dan Beck.

I like building web projects using Blazor / ASP.NET and React / Node.js I’m currently working on building a Resolution Tracker App, using a React/Typescript front-end and an ASP.NET Web Api (accessing a PostgreSQL database).
- 🌱 I just finished certificate course through [Code You](https://code-you.org/): Software Development with .NET and C#!
